                                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>Competing is a conflict style that focuses on one’s own needs and disregards the needs of others. People who use this style tend to pursue their own goals aggressively and prioritize winning the conflict. They may be willing to use power and authority to achieve their objectives. This style is suitable for urgent or important situations, or when a quick decision or self-protection is needed.</p>
											
                                        <p>However, competing styles cannot be used in all situations. In an article on the PON website, it says <i>"When adopting a competing style, people view interpersonal conflict resolution as win-lose games. Rather than recognizing the value of ensuring that each party walks away satisfied, disputants focus narrowly on claiming as much as they can for themselves. While value claiming is an important component of negotiation, a single-minded competitive orientation sacrifices value in the long run and perpetuates conflict."</i></p>
                                        <p>As a result, you should avoid using the competing style in the following situations:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>When you need to maintain and improve interpersonal relationships, otherwise you may hurt others. (You can use the compromising style, which can satisfy the needs of others by sacrificing some of your own needs.)</li>
                                                <li>When you need to encourage creative problem solving, communication and collaboration, otherwise you may suppress the ideas of others. (You can use the collaborative style, which can find a solution that both sides can accept by open communication, active listening and joint problem solving.)</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>When should you use the competing style? You can use the competing style in the following situations: 
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>When you need to show confidence, such as when you need to increase your influence or credibility, or when you need to deal with challenges from others.</li>
                                                <li>When you are sure that you are right and have sufficient reasons or evidence, such as having professional knowledge.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>

                                        <p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> A worker was electrocuted and fainted at the workplace. Someone wanted to pull him out with his hands, but you knew that this was very dangerous and that you needed to cut off the power supply or use insulating materials such as wooden sticks or bamboo poles to separate the patient from the power source. You didn’t have time to discuss with them, so you shouted: “Don’t touch him, turn off the main switch quickly!” Then you picked up a wooden stick and pushed away the electrocuted colleague, separating him from the power source. You checked his breathing and heartbeat and found that he still had signs of life, so you called an ambulance and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him. Fortunately, the ambulance arrived quickly and took him to the hospital. After the doctor’s rescue, he gradually regained consciousness.</p>
