                                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>Compromise is a conflict style that involves giving up some of one's own interests in exchange for meeting some of the other party's interests, thus reaching a middle ground. People who use this style are willing to make concessions in order to find a solution that both sides can accept. This style is applicable in situations where time is limited or both parties are evenly matched, or when temporary easing or maintaining of relationships is necessary.</p>
											
                                        <p>However, in the PON article, it is pointed out that <i>"Sometimes we try to resolve conflict by proposing seemingly equal compromises, such as meeting in the middle between two extreme positions, or by making a significant compromise just to move forward. Although a compromising conflict style can move a conversation forward, the solution is often unsatisfying and temporary because it doesnâ€™t address the root issues at stake."</i></p>
                                        <p>In summary, you should avoid using the compromise style in the following situations:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>When you need to address fundamental issues or conflicts, as it may lead to recurring problems. (You can use the collaborative style instead, which involves understanding the needs and interests of both parties to find win-win solutions.)</li>
                                                <li>When you need to assert confidence, as you may risk losing important interests or goals. (You can use the competitive style instead, actively pursuing your own objectives to win the conflict.)</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Let me explain in which situations the compromise style should be used: 
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>When you need a quick or temporary solution, such as when time is limited or the issue is not significant.</li>
                                                <li>When both parties' goals have some degree of validity, without clear right or wrong.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>

                                        <p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> It's already 9 PM, and my child is still drawing while I want him to brush his teeth and go to bed. I walk over to him and see that he's working on a beautiful landscape drawing, putting a lot of effort into it. I say, "Sweetie, you've done a great job with your drawing today, but it's getting late now, and it's time for you to brush your teeth and go to sleep." He looks up at me and says, "Mom, I haven't finished yet. I want to complete this drawing before going to bed." I know he loves drawing, and I respect his interests and talent, but I'm also concerned that staying up too late will affect his energy and learning the next day. I consider the issue to be less significant in this situation, so I choose to resolve our conflict using a compromise style. I say, "Can you just draw for 10 more minutes and then brush your teeth and go to sleep? You can continue tomorrow morning." He thinks for a moment and says, "Okay, just 10 minutes then." I smile and say, "Alright, hurry and draw, I'll come and get you in 10 minutes." He finishes his drawing and then brushes his teeth and goes to sleep. While he didn't fully satisfy his desire, he also didn't give up his hobby. Although I didn't make him go to bed on time, I didn't harm his self-esteem and creativity either. We both made some concessions for each other and maintained a harmonious relationship.</p>
